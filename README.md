Asap-Alap
=========

Asap-Alap Scheduling Algorithm in C++

1. Compute the ASAP and ALAP schedules for directed acyclic graphs. In this step, your program
should compute the ALAP for the smallest possible latency.
2. Then your program should prompt for the latency (in number of steps) with respect to which the
values of ALAP will be computed.
